# PR-LPR-RPI
This project will teach everyone how to create a small LPR system using Raspberry Pi 5 with a camera, AI Object Detection, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to automatically read license plates in real conditions and display results via GUI.

Equipment used
- Raspberry Pi 5 (RAM 8GB): Embedded brain for running AI and controlling devices
- Pi Camera (Module 3): Used to take pictures of license plates
- AI model (YOLOv8n): For detecting license plates and extracting text in images
- Tesseract OCR: For reading text from images
